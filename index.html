      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi👋, <br> <br>
        I’m Carley! With 4+ years of experience in fitness coaching, I specialise
        in helping clients achieve their goals sustainably and confidently. I
        hold certifications in Strength &amp; Conditioning, Nutrition Coaching,
        and Pre/Postnatal Training.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I work with individuals in
        <strong>Milton Keynes</strong> and <strong>Hereford</strong>, offering
        tailored fitness programmes that fit your lifestyle, whether you're a
        busy professional 💼, a new parent 🤰, or just beginning your fitness
        journey 💪. Together, we’ll build a plan that prioritises your goals,
        health, and well-being.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Beyond coaching, I’m also a competitive powerlifter, and in 2024, 
        I placed second in the British Showdown Championships. 
        Strength training has transformed my own journey, 
        and I’m passionate about helping others discover the 
        same empowerment through fitness.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Key Values:</strong></p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>✅ Sustainability Over Quick Fixes</strong></li>
        <p>Fitness should fit into your life—not take over it. I focus on long-term, realistic strategies that help you build strength and confidence without extreme restrictions or burnout. Whether your goal is lifting heavier, feeling stronger, or simply moving better, we’ll create a plan that works for you.</p>
        <br>        
        <li><strong>✅ Training That’s Tailored to You</strong></li>
        <p>No two clients are the same, and neither are their fitness journeys. Your programme will be built around your goals, lifestyle, and preferences, ensuring you see progress in a way that feels enjoyable and rewarding.</p>
        <br>
        <li><strong>✅ Empowerment Through Strength</strong></li>
        <p>Strength training is about more than just lifting weights—it’s about unlocking your full potential. As a competitive powerlifter, I know firsthand how strength can transform both body and mind. I want to help you feel strong, capable, and confident in every aspect of life.</p>
        <br>
        <li><strong>✅ A Supportive and Inclusive Space</strong></li>
        <P>Fitness should be a positive experience. Whether you’re stepping into the gym for the first time or working towards a competition, you’ll always have my full support. I’m here to guide, motivate, and celebrate every win—big or small.</P>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Looking forward to helping you achieve your goals! 💪🔥</p>

        <p>Carley is a fantastic PT & Class Instructor. After telling her the specific areas of my body that I wanted to target, she put together a personalised PT session that would help me to reach my goals. I couldn't be happier with the results so far. Carley is firm, but patient & I always enjoy my sessions, whilst still seeing progression. I have also been going to Carley's Total Body & Conditioning classes for nearly three years. Great classes, she always motivates us, with a diverse range of exercises, that have been a great asset to the PT sessions. I honestly can't recommend Carley enough. If you want results, you won't be disappointed.</p>

          <p>When I first went to Carley I had little self confidence and had hit a rut with fitness.
            Carley has been such an incredible trainer and not only helped me with my self confidence but with getting my strength back after second c-section.
            I felt totally comfortable from day one and would 100% recommend her to anyone.

          <p>I started a weekly PT session with Carley just over 1 year ago. I was looking at introducing weights & after a tough winter with a big lifestyle change, I was feeling overweight, tired & unfit! I absolutely love my weekly hour with Carley, she’s very knowledgeable, calm, relaxed & quietly pushes you beyond your boundaries. Carley was the catalyst I needed to put my health at the top of my priority list. I am continuing to build strength and confidence & I look forward to the sessions every week, thank you Carley. Highly recommend!</p>
