                    <h1>Nutrition Hacks for Fat Loss</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p class="preview-text">
                        Fat loss doesn’t have to be miserable – or biscuit-free. These simple, science-backed hacks are designed to work with your lifestyle, not against it. Tried and tested by real clients (including those hopelessly in love with Hobnobs).
                    </p>

                    <div class="full-article">
                        <p>Let’s face it, fat loss can feel like a minefield. One minute you’re eating clean, the next you’re knee-deep in a packet of Hobnobs wondering what happened.</p>
                        <br>
                
                        <p>Been there. Trained clients through it. I’ve coached people who could write a love letter to Nutella.</p>
                        <br>
                
                        <p>As a Level 4 qualified nutrition coach and personal trainer, I’m here to tell you: you don’t need to cut out carbs, live off lettuce, or apologise for liking chocolate. Fat loss doesn’t have to be miserable. It just needs a strategy that works with your lifestyle, not against it.</p>
                        <br>
                
                        <p>So, here are my top nutrition hacks for fat loss, tried, tested, and sprinkled with a bit of humour (because if we can’t laugh while dieting, what’s even the point?).</p>
                        <br>
                
                        <hr>
                        <br>
                
                        <h3>1. Prioritise Protein Like It’s Your Job</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Protein: the Beyoncé of your meals, should always be front and centre.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Because protein keeps you fuller for longer, supports lean muscle (especially if you’re training), and burns more calories just by being digested.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Hack it:</strong> Build your meals around protein. Chicken, tofu, prawns, eggs, Greek yoghurt – anything that doesn’t come in a wrapper gets bonus points.</p>
                        <br>
                
                        <hr>
                        <br>
                
                        <h3>2. Use a Smaller Plate (It’s Not Cheating, It’s Psychology)</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Portion sizes have ballooned. What we call a “standard plate” now could feed a small army.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Hack it:</strong> Use a side plate. Trick your brain into thinking you’re eating more than you are. Also – chew your food. Your stomach isn’t in a hurry.</p>
                        <br>
                
                        <hr>
                        <br>
                
                        <h3>3. Create a Calorie Buffer (aka The Social Life Saver)</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Going out for dinner or having a roast? Great! You don’t need to avoid real life for your goals.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Hack it:</strong> Eat lighter earlier in the day – lean protein, veg, low-cal snacks – so you’ve got more calories to play with later. Like budgeting, but tastier.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>And no, don’t starve yourself all day before brunch. That’s not clever, that’s chaos.</p>
                        <br>
                
                        <hr>
                        <br>
                
                        <h3>4. Don’t Drink Your Calories (Unless It’s Wine… Joking. Sort of.)</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Lattes, smoothies, juices – they sound healthy but are often packed with calories.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Hack it:</strong> Stick to water, black coffee, herbal tea, or zero-cal drinks. Save calories for food you actually chew. Your stomach (and jeans) will thank you.</p>
                        <br>
                
                        <hr>
                        <br>
                
                        <h3>5. Add More Fibre (Your Gut Will Throw a Party)</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Fibre is underrated. It keeps you full, helps digestion, and reduces cravings.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Hack it:</strong> Pile on the veg, go for wholegrains, and throw beans or lentils into meals. Bonus: you might forget biscuits even exist. (OK, maybe just one.)</p>
                        <br>
                
                        <hr>
                        <br>
                
                        <h3>6. Structure Your Meals, No More ‘Snackcidentally’ Eating Everything</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Random snacking leads to random results. Structure = sanity.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Hack it:</strong> Stick to three proper meals and one planned snack. Keeps blood sugar stable and prevents fridge wanderings that end in crisp negotiations.</p>
                        <br>
                
                        <hr>
                        <br>
                
                        <h3>7. Ditch the All-or-Nothing Mentality</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>“I had one biscuit, might as well have five…” Sound familiar?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Hack it:</strong> One off-plan moment doesn’t ruin progress. What matters is what you do next. Drink some water, eat some veg, carry on. Progress > perfection.</p>
                        <br>
                
                        <hr>
                        <br>
                
                        <h3>Final Thoughts: Fat Loss Doesn’t Have to Be a Grind</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>There’s no magic – just small, smart shifts done consistently. These hacks work because they fit into real life. And if you feel like giving up? I’ve seen clients push through cake-heavy offices, hangovers, and snack drawer temptations. You’re not alone.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Pick one or two hacks to start. Let them become habits. That’s how you build something that sticks – no detox teas required.</p>
                        <br>

                    <h1>Why BMI is the Worst Way to Assess Your Body (and Why We Should All Stop Using It)</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p class="preview-text">
                        Let’s talk about BMI – the Body Mass Index. You know, that little number doctors love to pull out of nowhere to tell you whether you’re “healthy” or “overweight.” But here’s the thing: <strong>BMI is one of the worst ways to measure body composition...</strong>
                    </p>
                        <!-- Add an image here -->

                    <div class="full-article">
                        <p>... and yet it’s still used everywhere – from GP health checks to insurance forms to IVF eligibility (yep, more on that nonsense later).</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>If you’ve ever been told you’re overweight despite feeling strong, fit, and healthy, you’re not alone. Let’s break down why BMI is outdated, misleading, and honestly, about as useful as a chocolate teapot.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <h3>What is BMI, and Why is it So Bad?</h3>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>BMI was invented in the 1830s (yes, before modern medicine was even a thing) by a mathematician – not a doctor, a mathematician – called Adolphe Quetelet. It’s a simple equation:</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p><strong>BMI = weight (kg) ÷ height (m²)</strong></p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>Seems straightforward, right? That’s exactly the problem. It only considers your height and weight, <strong>not</strong> your muscle mass, fat percentage, bone density, or even where your body stores fat.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>Imagine this: you’ve been training hard, lifting weights, feeling amazing, but then you go for a health check and get told you’re “overweight” because your BMI is over 25. Meanwhile, your mate who hasn’t exercised in years but is naturally slim gets a “healthy” BMI. Does that make sense? Absolutely not.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <h3>The “Overweight” Lie</h3>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had clients go for routine health checks, feeling great, only to be told they need to “lose weight” because their BMI is over 25. Some of these people are lean, muscular, and healthier than ever, yet suddenly they’re labelled as unhealthy.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>This can have huge consequences. It messes with people’s confidence, encourages unnecessary dieting, and worst of all, it can make people who are actually healthy feel like they aren’t.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <h3>BMI and IVF: The Unfair Barrier</h3>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>Many fertility clinics refuse IVF treatment to people with a BMI over 30, no matter how fit or healthy they actually are. Imagine working hard, eating well, lifting weights, feeling strong – and then being told you can’t even try for a baby because of a meaningless number.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <h3>So, What Should We Use Instead?</h3>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>Luckily, there are way better ways to measure health and body composition than BMI.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Body Fat Percentage – This actually tells you how much of your body is fat vs. muscle.</li>
                            <li>Waist-to-Hip Ratio – A better indicator of metabolic health and risk of disease.</li>
                            <li>Strength, Fitness, and Overall Wellbeing – How do you feel? Are you strong? Do you have energy?</li>
                            <li>DEXA Scans & InBody Scans – If you want a deep dive, these scans show your muscle, fat, and bone density breakdown.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        
                        <hr>
                        <br>
