                    <br>
                    <p class="preview-text">
                        Let’s talk about BMI—the Body Mass Index. You know, that little number doctors love to pull out of nowhere to tell you whether you’re “healthy” or “overweight.” But here’s the thing: BMI is one of the worst ways to measure body composition...

                    <button class="read-more-btn">Read More</button>
                    
                    <div class="full-article">
                        <p>... and yet it’s still used everywhere—from GP health checks to insurance forms to IVF eligibility (yep, more on that nonsense later).</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>If you’ve ever been told you’re overweight despite feeling strong, fit, and healthy, you’re not alone. Let’s break down why BMI is outdated, misleading, and honestly, about as useful as a chocolate teapot.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <h3>What is BMI, and Why is it So Bad?</h3>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>BMI was invented in the 1830s (yes, before modern medicine was even a thing) by a mathematician—not a doctor, a mathematician—called Adolphe Quetelet. It’s a simple equation:</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p><strong>BMI = weight (kg) ÷ height (m²)</strong></p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>Seems straightforward, right? That’s exactly the problem. It only considers your height and weight, <strong>not</strong> your muscle mass, fat percentage, bone density, or even where your body stores fat.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>Imagine this: you’ve been training hard, lifting weights, feeling amazing, but then you go for a health check and get told you’re “overweight” because your BMI is over 25. Meanwhile, your mate who hasn’t exercised in years but is naturally slim gets a “healthy” BMI. Does that make sense? Absolutely not.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <h3>The “Overweight” Lie</h3>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had clients go for routine health checks, feeling great, only to be told they need to “lose weight” because their BMI is over 25. Some of these people are lean, muscular, and healthier than ever, yet suddenly they’re labelled as unhealthy.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>This can have huge consequences. It messes with people’s confidence, encourages unnecessary dieting, and worst of all, it can make people who are actually healthy feel like they aren’t.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <h3>BMI and IVF: The Unfair Barrier</h3>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>Many fertility clinics refuse IVF treatment to people with a BMI over 30, no matter how fit or healthy they actually are. Imagine working hard, eating well, lifting weights, feeling strong—and then being told you can’t even try for a baby because of a meaningless number.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <h3>So, What Should We Use Instead?</h3>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>Luckily, there are way better ways to measure health and body composition than BMI.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Body Fat Percentage – This actually tells you how much of your body is fat vs. muscle.</li>
                            <li>Waist-to-Hip Ratio – A better indicator of metabolic health and risk of disease.</li>
                            <li>Strength, Fitness, and Overall Wellbeing – How do you feel? Are you strong? Do you have energy?</li>
                            <li>DEXA Scans & InBody Scans – If you want a deep dive, these scans show your muscle, fat, and bone density breakdown.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        
                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>BMI is not a measure of health. It’s an outdated system that ignores muscle mass, body fat percentage, and actual fitness. It labels fit people as overweight and lets unfit people fly under the radar.</p>
